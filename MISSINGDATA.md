# Functions I need:

loggedin(): no input, outputs a yes or no in boolean form, or a 0 for not logged in and a 1 for not logged in if bool unavailable

login(email, password): straightforwards

logout(): no input, check if loggedin() first, then toggle to log out

createaccount(email, password, probably other inputs): create and account, outputs loggedin() signal
