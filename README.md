# FOR TESTING:
One way to test: <br>
ensure you have node.js downloaded (node -v returns a number) <br>
run:    npm install http-server -g <br>
ensure you are in the Team-11 folder locally <br>
run:    http-server <br>
go to (in any browser): localhost:8080 <br><br>

**If you are having issues with localhost:8080, please clear your cashe & cookies and try again (crtl + shift + delete is a common shortcut)**
