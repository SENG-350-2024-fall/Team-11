# FOR TESTING:
One way to test:
ensure you have node.js downloaded (node -v returns a number)
run:    npm install http-server -g
ensure you are in the Team-11 folder locally
run:    http-server
go to (in any browser): localhost:8080

**If you are having issues with localhost:8080, please clear your chashe and try again (crtl + shift + delete is a common shortcut)**
