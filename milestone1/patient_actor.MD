| Assumptions  | Patient has submitted a virtual triage Patient fulfills all requirements outlined in 1.3 Patient is logged into their account                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Steps        | Patient views their virtual triage results Patient views recommended options Patient decides what option to take IF (one option given AND patient chooses an option)	Patient goes to suggested care facilityELSE IF (multiple options given AND patient chooses an option)	Patient chooses which care facility to go toELSE IF (patient is not in need of further care)	Patient remains as they areELSE IF (patient chooses none of the options)	IF (patient chooses a different care facility)		Patient is responsible for dealing with that themselves	ELSE IF (patent chooses to do nothing)		Patient remains where they are, as they are	END END Patient waits at home for notification to go to care facility, orPatient heads to care facility to wait there |
